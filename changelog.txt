Role Theme Switcher  1.1, 2007 Nov 01
------------------------
- Added support for Drupal cache system
  As caching system is a pretty tricky thing, after every change in Role Theme Switcher
  to see your changes ASAP I would advice you to empty the whole cache.
  Otherwise your users will see the changes only after your cache expire.
